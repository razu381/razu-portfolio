          Frontend Developer with a unique journey from healthcare professional
          to WordPress expert, now focusing on React development. My 4+ years
          customizing WordPress sites for international clients has honed my
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while developing my ability to
          understand client needs and deliver solutions that exceed
          expectations.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite successful freelancing, I'm driven by a desire to tackle more
          complex technical challenges. This pursuit of continuous growth has
          guided my career evolution—from earning a medical degree to mastering
          WordPress customization, and now expanding into React, Tailwind, and
          modern frontend frameworks, with familiarity in MongoDB and Express.
          I'm also actively studying core computer science fundamentals like
          data structures and algorithms to build a strong technical foundation.
          <br />
          <br />
          I thrive when pushing boundaries and solving difficult problems. My
          diverse background gives me a unique perspective on development
          challenges, while my experience working with international clients has
          refined my communication skills and adaptability.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond coding, I'm an avid reader who finds joy in exploring both
          fiction and non-fiction—a passion that continually expands my thinking
          and creativity.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm eager to contribute my technical skills, client experience, and
          passion for growth to a development team where I can continue to
          evolve while creating impactful digital solutions.
